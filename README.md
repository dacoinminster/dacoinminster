### Hi there!

<!--
**dacoinminster/dacoinminster** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is J.R. Willett, and I'm the lead front end engineer for Cozi Family Organizer, as well as a long-time cryptocurrency nerd.

Most of my github activity is on proprietary (private) repos, so you won't see much here - [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jrwillett) will give you a better picture of my work.

Ex Chao Opportunitas.
